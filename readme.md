## Running

```powershell
# Run all tests (pytest + doctests)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\run_all_tests.ps1

# Run only pytest
C:/Users/Alexa/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313/python.exe -m pytest

# Run demo
C:/Users/Alexa/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313/python.exe scripts\run_demo.py
```

## Test Coverage

✅ **51 passing tests** (including doctests)
- Character classes and stat modifiers
- Skill learning with class preferences
- Universal skills with categories
- Quest system with objectives
- Achievement tracking
- Combat, inventory, shop, bank systems

## Development Principles

- **Red-Green-Refactor** - Write failing test first, implement minimal code, refactor
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Entities separate from services, clear separation of concerns
- **Dependency Injection** - Protocol-based injection for testability (e.g., RandomProvider)
- **Semantic Naming** - Verbose, intention-revealing names following best practices
- **Co-located Tests** - Tests live next to source code (*_test.py pattern)
- **Flexible Specialization** - Classes provide bonuses without hard restrictions

## Documentation

- TDD workflow and testing conventions
- Architecture patterns and design principles
- Code style and naming conventions
- Common pitfalls to avoid
